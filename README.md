This repository contains every YouTube thumbnail on the [@leothepeo](https://www.youtube.com/@leothepeo) YouTube channel since August 7th of 2019.

These thumbnails are sorted into year folders, inside of which are month subfolders. All filenames begin with the output of `date -r file +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S-%3N`. In other words, all filenames begin with their year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond of modification.

There are two versions of every thumbnail, `small` & `large`:
- `small` thumbnail characteristics:
	- Filename ends with `small.jpg`.
	- `.jpg` files with 90% quality.
	- These are the thumbnails I upload to YouTube, to get under their 2 MB file size limit.
- `large` thumbnail characteristics:
	- Filename ends with `large.png`.
	- Lossless & scaled to 4K with no interpolation.
	- _**Preferred viewing experience.**_

A very small minority of thumbnails don't have `large` variants, I'm not sure why. In this case, viewing the `small` thumbnail is preferable.
